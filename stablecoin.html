        <section>
            <p>A <strong>stablecoin</strong> is a specialized category of cryptocurrency engineered to maintain a <strong>stable value</strong> and consistent <strong>purchasing power</strong> over time. Unlike typical cryptocurrencies that experience significant price swings, stablecoins are designed to act as a reliable <strong>medium of exchange</strong> and a <strong>store of value</strong> within the digital ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>To achieve this stability, they utilize several primary mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asset Pegging:</strong> Their value is linked to a specific asset or a basket of assets, most commonly <strong>fiat currency</strong> (like the U.S. dollar), <strong>commodities</strong> (like gold), or other <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Collateralization:</strong> Many are <strong>reserve-backed</strong>, meaning the issuer holds a pool of assets (e.g., Treasury bonds or bank deposits) that allow the token to be <strong>redeemable</strong> for the underlying value.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Stabilization:</strong> Some "synthetic" or <strong>algorithmic stablecoins</strong> rely on computer protocols to dynamically manage the token supply to maintain their price peg without a full physical reserve.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Analogy:</strong> If Bitcoin is like a <strong>volatile stock</strong> that can double or halve in value overnight, a stablecoin is like a <strong>digital casino chip</strong> —it is a specialized token you use inside the "blockchain casino" to play games or trade, but you can always take it back to the counter and exchange it for exactly one dollar.
            </blockquote>
