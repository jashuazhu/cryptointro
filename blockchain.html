        <section>
            <p>The choice between monolithic and modular blockchain architectures is a critical strategic decision in Web3 development, as it dictates how a system scales, handles data, and adapts to growth.</p>

            <h2>Monolithic Blockchains</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A monolithic blockchain is a system where all four core functions— execution, consensus, data availability, and settlement —operate together on a <strong>single, unified layer</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Tightly integrated architecture, vertical stacking, and native composability.</p>
            
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simpler Deployment:</strong> Consistent tools and APIs make it easier for developers to launch decentralized applications (dApps) without managing separate layers.</li>
                <li><strong>High Composability:</strong> Because all smart contracts exist in one environment, they can easily interact, which is vital for complex <strong>DeFi protocols</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalability Bottlenecks:</strong> All functions share resources; when activity spikes, the network can become congested, leading to slower speeds and higher fees.</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade Rigidity:</strong> Improving one component requires complex changes across the entire system, which can slow innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Ideal Scenarios:</strong> High-speed, performance-critical environments like <strong>ultra-fast trading or blockchain gaming</strong> (e.g., <strong>Solana</strong>); single-purpose dApps; and early-stage projects prioritizing speed to market.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>Modular Blockchains</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A modular blockchain <strong>unbundles</strong> core functions into separate, specialized layers, allowing each layer to focus on a specific task.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Specialized layers (e.g., <strong>Celestia</strong> for data availability and consensus, or <strong>Rollups</strong> for execution) and a focus on horizontal scaling.</p>

            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parallel Scalability:</strong> Each layer can scale independently, dramatically increasing transaction throughput.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Innovation:</strong> Developers can adopt cutting-edge solutions for individual layers without overhauling the entire network.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coordination Complexity:</strong> Managing interactions between multiple modules increases the engineering burden and operational challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragmentation and Security Risks:</strong> Liquidity is often fragmented across different rollups, and the system relies on <strong>bridges</strong> that can introduce new attack surfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Ideal Scenarios:</strong> High-volume <strong>DeFi protocols</strong> requiring low gas fees; <strong>Appchains</strong> that need custom governance or performance controls (e.g., <strong>dYdX</strong>); and projects that want to inherit the security of an established layer like Ethereum while optimizing for efficiency.</p>

            <strong>Analogy:</strong> A <strong>monolithic chain</strong> is like a <strong>small, high-end boutique hotel</strong> where the manager also handles the cooking, cleaning, and concierge services; it is easy to coordinate and offers a seamless experience, but service slows down significantly if a large tour group arrives at once.<br><br>
            A <strong>modular chain</strong> is like a <strong>major airport hub</strong> where different companies handle the flights, baggage, security, and retail; it can handle thousands of people at once through specialization, but it requires complex schedules and transit systems (bridges) to make sure everyone gets to their destination safely.
